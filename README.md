This is the autosplitter for DMC1, with a full working start, split and reset.

LRT wasnt wished from the community, so there is no.
Doorsplitter will be finished in the near future.
And the M23 is currently worked on to let it split by itself. Tho the community said its not bad, if its not working.

Doorsplitter & M23 Split are the main things to be added, but start, split and reset is already usable, just be aware to split M23 by yourself.
